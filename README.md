# randomize_image_names

What randomize_image_names does is to rename image files randomly. To use it, make sure you have Python installed, place randomize_random_file.py into the folder that houses the images whose names you wish to rename, and then run the application.

Note: I understand this is a crude way of doing things and providing a path in a terminal or CMD would be much better.
